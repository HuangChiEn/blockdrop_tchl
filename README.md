# A unofficial re-implementation of Block Drop in torch-lightning

## Motivation
### Block Drop is a pioneer work in dynamic NN with reinforce learning, while the official version was written in old torch version with py2.x.
### It's sad.. So, we reimplement block drop in torch-lightning, a promised framework to benefit someone who interested in this field.

This is the code accompanying the work:
